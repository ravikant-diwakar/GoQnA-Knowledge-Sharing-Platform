## Technology Stack

### Frontend
| Technology | Purpose | Version |
|------------|---------|---------|
| React | UI Components | 18.3.1 |
| TypeScript | Type Safety | 5.5.3 |
| React Router | Navigation | 6.22.0 |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling | 3.4.1 |
| Firebase SDK | Realtime Database & Auth | 10.8.0 |

### Backend
| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Firebase Firestore | NoSQL Database |
| Firebase Auth | User Authentication |
| Express.js | API Endpoints (Future) |
| Vite | Build Tool | 

> [!NOTE]
> Express.js is currently scaffolded for future backend expansion—Firebase handles most real-time and auth functionality.

### Development Tools
- ESLint + Prettier (Code Quality)
- PostCSS (CSS Processing)
- Concurrently (Parallel Scripts)
- Date-fns (Date Formatting)

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure Node.js ≥18.x and a configured Firebase project are available before setup.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥18.x
- Firebase Project
- Git

### Setup Steps
1. Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravikant-diwakar/GoQnA-Knowledge-Sharing-Platform.git
cd GoQnA-Knowledge-Sharing-Platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
cd src/firebase && npm install
```

3. Firebase Configuration:
```bash
# Create .env file in root directory
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

4. Start development servers:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

> [!TIP]
> Use ```npm run dev:all```to run both frontend and backend in parallel during local development.

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Frontend: Login/Signup
    Frontend->>Firebase: Auth Request
    Firebase->>Frontend: JWT Token
    Frontend->>Local Storage: Store Token
    Frontend->>Firestore: User Profile Data
```

### Execution Flow
1. **User Journey**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>React: Navigate to /ask
    React->>Firebase: Check auth state
    Firebase->>React: Auth status
    alt Authenticated
        React->>User: Show question form
        User->>React: Submit question
        React->>Firestore: Add document
    else Not Authenticated
        React->>User: Redirect to /login
    end
```

2. **Data Flow**:
```typescript
// Typical data fetching pattern
const { data, loading, error } = useFirestore<Question>('questions')
  .getDocuments(
    [/* query conditions */],
    'createdAt', 
    'desc', 
    20
  );
```

> [!NOTE]
> This pattern ensures real-time sync and paginated fetching for Firestore collections.

> [!CAUTION]
> This architecture provides a **scalable foundation** but requires additional security measures and error handling for production readiness. The Firebase-centric approach enables rapid development but needs careful attention to security rules and query optimization.

### Data Modeling
**Question Document**
```typescript
interface Question {
  title: string;
  body: string;
  tags: string[];
  views: number;
  upvotes: number;
  answerCount: number;
  isSolved: boolean;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  userId: string;
}
```

### Security
> [!WARNING]
> The following Firestore rules are minimal and intended for development only.
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must customize these rules before deploying to production to prevent unauthorized access.

Production deployment requires Firestore Security Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /questions/{questionId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```
